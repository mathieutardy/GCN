# Graph Convolutional Network

Implementation of a GCN. The goal here is to classify nodes, which are proteins in our example. We want to predict whether the protein is healthy or if it is a disease based on the structure of the graph.

### Dataset:
- 20 graphs for training
- 2 graphs for testing of 2372 nodes on average
- Each node has 50 features and 121 labels
